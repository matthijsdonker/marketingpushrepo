# marketingpushrepo

# This repo includes a feature that causes an organization to get a data frame that contains customer emails from a particular country and some of their financial data 
so that the organization can target them for a marketing push. In the function, a filter is used that ensures that the entered country is selected, 
furthermore, personal identifiable information is removed. In addition, 2 datasets are merged based on ID and a column credit_card number is removed. 
Finally, the columns are renamed to make the output easier to read for people in the organization.

The function should contain the paths to 2 datasets and a country to filter by.The repo also contains a file showing the output when filtering on 'Netherlands' and 2 example datasets.

Note: the datasets in this repo are fake and are for an assignment only.
